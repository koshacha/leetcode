# 2627. Debounce

Given a function fn and a time in milliseconds t, return a debounced version of that function.

A debounced function is a function whose execution is delayed by t milliseconds and whose execution is cancelled if it is called again within that window of time. The debounced function should also receive the passed parameters.

```js
/**
 * @param {Function} fn
 * @param {number} t milliseconds
 * @return {Function}
 */
var debounce = function(fn, t) {
    let timer = null;
    return function(...args) {
        clearTimeout(timer);
        timer = setTimeout(fn, t, ...args);
    }
};

/**
 * const log = debounce(console.log, 100);
 * log('Hello'); // cancelled
 * log('Hello'); // cancelled
 * log('Hello'); // Logged at t=100ms
 */
```
