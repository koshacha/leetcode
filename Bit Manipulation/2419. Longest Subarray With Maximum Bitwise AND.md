# 2419. Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND

You are given an integer array nums of size n.

Consider a non-empty subarray from nums that has the maximum possible bitwise AND.

In other words, let k be the maximum value of the bitwise AND of any subarray of nums. Then, only subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to k should be considered.
Return the length of the longest such subarray.

The bitwise AND of an array is the bitwise AND of all the numbers in it.

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

```ts
function longestSubarray(nums: number[]): number {
    let max = -Infinity, longest = 0, current = 0;

    for (let n of nums) {
        if (n === max) current++;
        else {
            if (n > max) {
                max = n;
                longest = current = 1;
            } else current = 0;
        }

        if (current > longest) longest = current;
    }

    return longest;
};
```
