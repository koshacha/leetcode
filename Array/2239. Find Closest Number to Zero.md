# 2239. Find Closest Number to Zero

Given an integer array nums of size n, return the number with the value closest to 0 in nums. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.

```ts
function findClosestNumber(nums: number[]): number {
    let diff = Infinity, res = nums[0];
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (Math.abs(num) < diff) {
            diff = Math.abs(num);
            res = num;
        }

        if (Math.abs(num) === diff) {
            res = Math.max(res, num);
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```
