# 1381. Design a Stack With Increment Operation

Design a stack that supports increment operations on its elements.

Implement the CustomStack class:

CustomStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is the maximum number of elements in the stack.
void push(int x) Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack has not reached the maxSize.
int pop() Pops and returns the top of the stack or -1 if the stack is empty.
void inc(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val. If there are less than k elements in the stack, increment all the elements in the stack.

```ts
class CustomStack {
    private stack: number[] = [];
    constructor(private maxSize: number = 0) {}

    private isFull(): boolean {
        return this.stack.length === this.maxSize;
    }

    push(x: number): void {
        if (this.isFull()) return;
        this.stack.push(x);
    }

    pop(): number {
        if (this.stack.length === 0) return -1;
        return this.stack.pop();
    }

    increment(k: number, val: number): void {
        for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(this.stack.length, k); i++) {
            this.stack[i] += val;
        }
    }
}

/**
 * Your CustomStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new CustomStack(maxSize)
 * obj.push(x)
 * var param_2 = obj.pop()
 * obj.increment(k,val)
 */
```
