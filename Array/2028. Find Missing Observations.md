# 2028. Find Missing Observations

You have observations of n + m 6-sided dice rolls with each face numbered from 1 to 6. n of the observations went missing, and you only have the observations of m rolls. Fortunately, you have also calculated the average value of the n + m rolls.

You are given an integer array rolls of length m where rolls[i] is the value of the ith observation. You are also given the two integers mean and n.

Return an array of length n containing the missing observations such that the average value of the n + m rolls is exactly mean. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If no such array exists, return an empty array.

The average value of a set of k numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by k.

Note that mean is an integer, so the sum of the n + m rolls should be divisible by n + m.

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} rolls
 * @param {number} mean
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var missingRolls = function(rolls, mean, n) {
    const sumTotal = mean * (rolls.length + n);
    const sumRolls = rolls.reduce((sum, o) => sum + o);
    let sumMissing = sumTotal - sumRolls;

    if (sumMissing < n || sumMissing > 6 * n) return [];
    const res = Array.from({ length: n }, () => 1);
    sumMissing -= n;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (!sumMissing) break;
        const add = Math.min(5, sumMissing);
        res[i] += add;
        sumMissing -= add;
    }

    return res;
};
```
