# 731. My Calendar II

You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a triple booking.

A triple booking happens when three events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to all the three events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

```ts
type Booking = [number, number];

class MyCalendarTwo {
    calendar: Booking[] = [];
    overlaps: Booking[] = [];

    book(start: number, end: number): boolean {
        const { calendar, overlaps } = this;

        for(let [from, to] of overlaps) {
            if(start < to && end > from) return false;
        }

        for(let [from, to] of calendar){
            if(start < to && end > from) {
                overlaps.push([Math.max(from, start), Math.min(to, end)]);
            }
        }

        calendar.push([start, end]);
        return true;
    }
}
```
