# 1652. Defuse the Bomb

You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code of length of n and a key k.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.

If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.
As code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].

Given the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!

```ts
function decrypt(code: number[], k: number): number[] {
    const { abs } = Math;
    const result = Array.from({ length: code.length }, () => 0);
    const index = (n: number) => (n + code.length) % code.length;

    if (k === 0) return result;

    let l = 0, sum = 0;
    for (let r = 0; r < code.length + abs(k) - 1; r++) {
        sum += code[index(r)];

        if (r - l + 1 > abs(k)) {
            sum -= code[index(l)];
            l = index(l + 1);
        }

        if (r - l + 1 === abs(k)) {
            if (k > 0) {
                result[index(l - 1)] = sum;
            } else if (k < 0) {
                result[index(r + 1)] = sum;
            }
        }
    }


    return result;
};
```
