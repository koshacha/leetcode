# 1975. Maximum Matrix Sum

You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:

Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.
Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.

Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

```ts
function maxMatrixSum(matrix: number[][]): number {
    let min = Infinity, sum = 0, negativeCount = 0;

    for (let row of matrix) {
        for (let cell of row) {
            const abs = Math.abs(cell);
            min = Math.min(min, abs);
            sum += abs;

            if (cell < 0) {
                negativeCount++;
            }
        }
    }

    return negativeCount % 2 === 0 ? sum : sum - min * 2;
};
```
