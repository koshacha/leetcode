# 1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence

Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.

Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.

A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.

```ts
function isPrefixOfWord(sentence: string, searchWord: string): number {
    const len = searchWord.length;

    let window = '', l = 0, word = 1;

    for (let r = 0; r < sentence.length; r++) {
        window += sentence[r];
        if (r - l + 1 > len) {
            l++;
            window = window.substring(1);
        }

        if (sentence[r] === ' ') {
            word++;
        }

        if (window === searchWord && (l === 0 || sentence[l - 1] === ' ') ) {
            return word;
        }
    }

    return -1;
};
```
