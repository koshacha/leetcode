# 1768. Merge Strings Alternately

You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

```ts
function mergeAlternately(word1: string, word2: string): string {
    let swapped = false;

    if (word2.length > word1.length) {
        [word1, word2] = [word2, word1];
        swapped = true;
    }

    let str = '', i = 0;

    while (i < word2.length) {
        if (swapped) {
            str += word2[i] + word1[i];
        } else {
            str += word1[i] + word2[i];
        }

        i++;
    }

    str += word1.substring(i);

    return str;
};
```
