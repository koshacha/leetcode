# 1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String

A fancy string is a string where no three consecutive characters are equal.

Given a string s, delete the minimum possible number of characters from s to make it fancy.

Return the final string after the deletion. It can be shown that the answer will always be unique.

```ts
function makeFancyString(s: string): string {
    let res = '', prev = '', count = 0;

    for (let char of s) {
        if (prev === char) {
            count++;
            if (count > 1) {
                continue;
            }
        } else {
            count = 0;
        }

        prev = char;
        res += char;
    }

    return res;
};
```
