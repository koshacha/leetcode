# 2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings

Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

Append the character '0' zero times.
Append the character '1' one times.
This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

```ts
function countGoodStrings(low: number, high: number, zero: number, one: number): number {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    const dp = new Map<number, number>();

    const dfs = (length: number) => {
        if (length > high) return 0;
        if (dp.has(length)) return dp.get(length);

        let res = length >= low ? 1 : 0;
        res += dfs(length + zero) + dfs(length + one);

        dp.set(length, res);

        return res % MOD;
    }

    return dfs(0);
};
```
