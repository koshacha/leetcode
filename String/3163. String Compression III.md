# 3163. String Compression III

Given a string word, compress it using the following algorithm:

Begin with an empty string comp. While word is not empty, use the following operation:
Remove a maximum length prefix of word made of a single character c repeating at most 9 times.
Append the length of the prefix followed by c to comp.
Return the string comp.

```ts
function compressedString(word: string): string {
    let group = "", count = 0, answer = "";

    for (let i = 0; i <= word.length; i++) {
        let char = word[i];

        if ((count && group !== char) || count === 9) {
            answer += count + group;
            count = 0;
        }

        group = char;
        count ++;
    }

    return answer;
};
```
