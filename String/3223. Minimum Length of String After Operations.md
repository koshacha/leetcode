# 3223. Minimum Length of String After Operations

You are given a string s.

You can perform the following process on s any number of times:

Choose an index i in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i], and at least one character to the right that is also equal to s[i].
Delete the closest character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i].
Delete the closest character to the right of index i that is equal to s[i].
Return the minimum length of the final string s that you can achieve.

```ts
function minimumLength(s: string): number {
    const mp = new Map<string, number>();
    let answer = 0;

    for (let char of s) {
        mp.set(char, (mp.get(char) ?? 0) + 1);
    }

    for (let [char, count] of mp) {
        while (count >= 3) {
            count -= 2;
        }

        answer += count;
    }

    return answer;
};
```
