# 2914. Minimum Number of Changes to Make Binary String Beautiful

You are given a 0-indexed binary string s having an even length.

A string is beautiful if it's possible to partition it into one or more substrings such that:

Each substring has an even length.
Each substring contains only 1's or only 0's.
You can change any character in s to 0 or 1.

Return the minimum number of changes required to make the string s beautiful.

```ts
function minChanges(s: string): number {
    let res = 0;

    let p1 = 0, p2 = 1;

    while (p2 < s.length) {
        if (s[p1] !== s[p2]) res++;

        p1 += 2;
        p2 += 2;
    }

    return res;
};
```
