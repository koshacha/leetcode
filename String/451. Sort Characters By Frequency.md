# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

```ts
function frequencySort(s: string): string {
    let res = "";
    const dict = new Map<string, number>();
    const trie = new MaxPriorityQueue({
        priority: (o) => o[0]
    });

    for (let char of s) {
        dict.set(char, (dict.get(char) ?? 0) + 1);
    }

    dict.forEach((freq, char) => {
        trie.enqueue([freq, char]);
    });

    for (let { element: [freq, char] } of trie.toArray()) {
        for (let i = 0; i < freq; i++) {
            res += char;
        }
    }

    return res;
};
```
