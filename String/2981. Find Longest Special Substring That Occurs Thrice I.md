# 2981. Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I

You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.

A string is called special if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string "abc" is not special, whereas the strings "ddd", "zz", and "f" are special.

Return the length of the longest special substring of s which occurs at least thrice, or -1 if no special substring occurs at least thrice.

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

```ts
function maximumLength(s: string): number {
    const map = new Map<string, number>();

    let char = s[0], l = 0, max = -1;

    for (let r = 0; r < s.length; r++) {
        if (char !== s[r]) {
            char = s[r];
            l = r;
        }
        
        for (let j = r - l + 1; j > 0; j--) {
            const key = `${char},${j}`;
            map.set(key, (map.get(key) ?? 0) + 1);

            if (map.get(key) >= 3) {
                max = Math.max(max, j);
            }
        }
    }

    return max;
};
```
