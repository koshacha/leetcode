# 884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences

A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

```ts
function uncommonFromSentences(s1: string, s2: string): string[] {
    const dict: Array<Set<string>> = [];
    const words = [
        ...s1.split(' '),
        ...s2.split(' '),
    ];

    words.forEach((w) => {
        let index = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < dict.length; i++) {
            if (dict[i] && dict[i].has(w)) {
                index = i + 1;
                dict[i].delete(w);
            }
        }

        if (!dict[index]) dict[index] = new Set();
        dict[index].add(w);
    });

    return Array.from(dict.shift());
};
```
