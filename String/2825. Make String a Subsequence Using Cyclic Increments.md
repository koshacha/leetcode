# 2825. Make String a Subsequence Using Cyclic Increments

You are given two 0-indexed strings str1 and str2.

In an operation, you select a set of indices in str1, and for each index i in the set, increment str1[i] to the next character cyclically. That is 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on, and 'z' becomes 'a'.

Return true if it is possible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 by performing the operation at most once, and false otherwise.

Note: A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.

```ts
function canMakeSubsequence(s: string, t: string): boolean {
    let i = 0;

    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === t[i]) i++;
        else if (t[i] && isNext(char, t[i])) i++;
    }

    return i === t.length;
};

function isNext(a: string, b: string) {
    return ((a.charCodeAt(0) + 1) === b.charCodeAt(0)) || (a === 'z' && b === 'a');
}
```
