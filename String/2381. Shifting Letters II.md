# 2381. Shifting Letters II

You are given a string s of lowercase English letters and a 2D integer array shifts where shifts[i] = [starti, endi, directioni]. For every i, shift the characters in s from the index starti to the index endi (inclusive) forward if directioni = 1, or shift the characters backward if directioni = 0.

Shifting a character forward means replacing it with the next letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'z' becomes 'a'). Similarly, shifting a character backward means replacing it with the previous letter in the alphabet (wrapping around so that 'a' becomes 'z').

Return the final string after all such shifts to s are applied.

```ts
function shiftingLetters(s: string, shifts: number[][]): string {
    const n = s.length;
    const diff = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    for (const [start, end, direction] of shifts) {
        diff[start] += direction === 1 ? 1 : -1;
        diff[end + 1] -= direction === 1 ? 1 : -1;
    }

    let shift = 0;
    const result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        shift += diff[i];
        const charCode = s.charCodeAt(i) - 97;
        const shiftedCharCode = (charCode + shift % 26 + 26) % 26 + 97;
        result.push(String.fromCharCode(shiftedCharCode));
    }

    return result.join('');

};
```
