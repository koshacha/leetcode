# 802. Find Eventual Safe States

There is a directed graph of n nodes with each node labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph is represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array graph where graph[i] is an integer array of nodes adjacent to node i, meaning there is an edge from node i to each node in graph[i].

A node is a terminal node if there are no outgoing edges. A node is a safe node if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (or another safe node).

Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

```ts
function eventualSafeNodes(graph: number[][]): number[] {
    const n = graph.length;
    const safe = new Map<number, boolean>();

    const dfs = (i: number): boolean => {
        if (safe.has(i)) return safe.get(i);
        safe.set(i, false);
        for (let nei of graph[i]) {
            if (!dfs(nei)) return safe.get(i);
        }
        safe.set(i, true);
        return safe.get(i);
    };

    const res = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (dfs(i)) res.push(i);
    }

    return res;
};
```
