# 3043. Find the Length of the Longest Common Prefix

You are given two arrays with positive integers arr1 and arr2.

A prefix of a positive integer is an integer formed by one or more of its digits, starting from its leftmost digit. For example, 123 is a prefix of the integer 12345, while 234 is not.

A common prefix of two integers a and b is an integer c, such that c is a prefix of both a and b. For example, 5655359 and 56554 have a common prefix 565 while 1223 and 43456 do not have a common prefix.

You need to find the length of the longest common prefix between all pairs of integers (x, y) such that x belongs to arr1 and y belongs to arr2.

Return the length of the longest common prefix among all pairs. If no common prefix exists among them, return 0.

```ts
class TrieNode {
    children: Record<number, TrieNode> = {};
}

const every = (n: number, cb: (digit: number) => false | void): void => {
    for (let c of n.toString()) {
        if (cb(Number(c)) === false) return;
    }
}

function longestCommonPrefix(arr1: number[], arr2: number[]): number {
    const trie = new TrieNode();
    let max = 0;

    arr1.forEach((w) => {
        let node = trie;
        every(w, (d) => {
            if (!node.children[d]) node.children[d] = new TrieNode();
            node = node.children[d];
        });
    });

    arr2.forEach((w) => {
        let node = trie, depth = 0;
        every(w, (d) => {
            if (!node.children[d]) return false;
            depth += 1;
            node = node.children[d];
        });
        max = Math.max(max, depth);
    });

    return max;
};
```
