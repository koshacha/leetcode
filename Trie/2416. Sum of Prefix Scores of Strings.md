# 2416. Sum of Prefix Scores of Strings

You are given an array words of size n consisting of non-empty strings.

We define the score of a string word as the number of strings words[i] such that word is a prefix of words[i].

For example, if words = ["a", "ab", "abc", "cab"], then the score of "ab" is 2, since "ab" is a prefix of both "ab" and "abc".
Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the sum of scores of every non-empty prefix of words[i].

Note that a string is considered as a prefix of itself.

```ts
class TrieNode {
    children: Record<string, TrieNode> = {};
    words: number = 0;
}

function sumPrefixScores(words: string[]): number[] {
    const trie = new TrieNode();
    const res: number[] = [];

    for (let index in words) {
        let node = trie;
        for (let l of words[index]) {
            if (!node.children[l]) node.children[l] = new TrieNode();
            node = node.children[l];
            node.words++;
        }
    }
    
    for (let index in words) {
        let node = trie;
        res[index] = 0;
        for (let l of words[index]) {
            node = node.children[l];
            res[index] += node.words;
        }
    }


    return res;
};
```
